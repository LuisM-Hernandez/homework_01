Code Refactor

The client wanted to optimize the website so it could have more web accesibility. I started consolidating code on the css so it could be more readable and cleaner, getting rid of innecesary lines of code. After that I started working on the HTML and started seeing some patterns. There were a lot of division tags that needed to be changed in order to be more specific and accesible. Those tags were changed to the corresponding <header>,<nav>,<section>,<article> and <footer> also the class attribute was deleted from each of those tag changes as they were not needed anymore. Added the company name on the tittle so it could've be seen more professional. To all the images on the site we added a brief description. After those changes were made I continued consolidating code on the css so it could look more cleaner and still be as efficient. Search engine optimization link wasn't working, it is fixed now, I added an id to that specific div on the image and deleted the class on the actual img tag because it was no longer needed. Substracting the comments we made the HTML cleaner, with less code and the css was considerably shorten mantaining its functions.
